## What is a server:
A server is a physical or virtual machine that provides services to other computers over a network. In this case, it hosts your website and responds to user requests.

## The role of the domain name:
The domain name, here "foobar.com," is a human-readable address that is converted into an IP address by the DNS. This allows users to access the site via an easy-to-remember address rather than using an IP address.

## What type of DNS record is "www" in www.foobar.com:
"www" is a subdomain, and the associated DNS record is an A record that links "www.foobar.com" to the IP address 8.8.8.8.

## The role of the web server:
The web server, in this case Nginx, acts as a gateway to receive HTTP requests from users and redirect them to the appropriate service (like the application server).

## The role of the application server:
The application server runs the logic of your website. It processes incoming requests, interacts with the database when necessary, and generates the content (e.g., HTML) to be returned to the user.

## The role of the database:
The database (in this case, MySQL) stores the structured data of the website, such as user information, products, or blog articles. The application server accesses it to read or write data.

## How the server communicates with the user's computer:
The server communicates with the user's computer via the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. This protocol transfers data from the web server to the user's browser, allowing them to view the website.

## Potential issues with this infrastructure:
Single Point of Failure (SPOF): With only one server, if that server fails, the entire site becomes inaccessible. This is a major point of vulnerability.

## Downtime during maintenance:
If you need to deploy a code update or perform server maintenance, you may have to restart Nginx or other services, causing temporary service interruptions.

## Inability to scale with high traffic:
With only one server, if the number of requests exceeds the machineâ€™s capacity, the site could slow down or become unavailable. It is not designed to handle heavy traffic load increases.
